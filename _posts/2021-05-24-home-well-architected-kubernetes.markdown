# Well Architected Kubernetes

No doubt, [Kubernetes](0)  is one of the best container orchestration platform present today. With excellent features that support scaling, zero-downtime deployments, service discovery, automatic rollout and rollback capabilities, it is perhaps the defacto go to platform. 

There is often a big knowledge transition needed for using Open-source Kubernetes for development and its production implementation. With number of different flavors of Kubernetes implementation it becomes a challenge. With this blog series I am planning to go through one step at a time for a [Well Architected Kubernetes](/well-architected-kubernetes-home). This is an attempt to apply my understanding of [AWS Well Architected framework](1) to the Kubenetes. This is the primary blog post with links to all smaller topis and will grow with time.

I will try to organize the posts in this series in the pillars as defined within [AWS Well Architected framework](1) and will add additional groups as needed.
