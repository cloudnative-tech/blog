# My First Post with Jekyll and Github Repo! - All Things Cloud Native
----------

I am starting this new blog to write about my experiences with different cloud native technologies in general but not limited to it. With the popular demand I am going to start with my journey, experience and tips to help you with getting [Kubernetes][1] certified administrator [CKA][2] and developer [CKAD][2].

I truely believe in open-source for technology, collaboration, knowledge sharing and its role in shaping a lot of things around us, this blog and all repositories in my [cloudnative-tech][4] github organization will be free to use and contribute. If you feel you have ideas, want to contribute, feel free to raise a PR or reach out to [me](/about) directly.

Best!
